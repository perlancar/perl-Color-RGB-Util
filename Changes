Revision history for Color-RGB-Util

0.57    2014-12-05 (PERLANCAR) (unreleased)

        - Rename module/dist from SHARYANTO-Color-Util to Color-RGB-Util.


0.56    2013-09-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Split from SHARYANTO-Utils to minimize
          dependencies (I'm trying to make Text::ANSITable work under Windows).
